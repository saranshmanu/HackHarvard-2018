### About the Project
People are taking greater care than ever about what they eat. Thatâ€™s why most smartphones already come with apps to track your health. So does the iPhone with Health app which tracks your Activity, Mindfulness and Sleep. And while your iPhone can track your Activity and Sleep pretty well on its own, using a manual input of the Nutrition section is quite a pain. Here is where Spot helps.

Everone gets choosy about what they eat. Everone has their own preference but sometimes when life gives you too much free food, making the right choices is of great significant value. What do you look for when you see a new food product? Calories? Fats? Gluten? How do you find a product that is best for you?

Imagine pointing your camera at your product and get all the information about the nutrition.

This concept built for the healthcare industry combines AR (augmented reality) mode and with help of AI (artificial intelligence) scans and identifies nutrition data of your meals.

After it has done recognising the product, the app calculates your calories, protein, or other nutrition values your decided you to keep track and shows you a calculation, preview of your meal and information.
